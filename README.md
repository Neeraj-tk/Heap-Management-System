# Heap-Management-System

Implemented a heap management system that uses a‌ ‌small‌ ‌amount‌ ‌of‌ ‌memory‌ ‌on‌ ‌the‌ ‌heap,‌ ‌and‌‌
allocates‌ ‌and‌ ‌deallocates‌ ‌the‌ ‌memory‌ ‌on‌ ‌that‌ ‌heap‌ ‌using‌ ‌the‌ ‌first‌ ‌fit‌ ‌allocation‌ ‌strategy.‌   

## FIRST FIT ALLOCATION STRATEGY
A resource allocation scheme (usually for memory). First Fit fits data into memory by scanning from the beginning of available memory to the end, until the first free space which is at least big enough to accept the data is found. This space is then allocated to the data.
